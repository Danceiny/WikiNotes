Variables are usually examined to understand the following:

* Central Tendency:
>A number of measures for the central tendency of a variable can be calculated, including the mean or average value, the median or the middle number based on an ordering of all values, and the mode or the most common value. Since the mean is sensitive to outliers, the trimmed mean may be considered which refers to a mean calculated after excluding extreme values. In addition, median values are often used to best represent a central value in situations involving outliers or skewed data.

* Variation: 
>Different numbers show the variation of the data setâ€™s distribution. The minimum and maximum values describe the entire range of the variable. Calculating the values for the different quartiles is helpful, and the calculation determines the points at which 25% (Q1), 50% (Q2), and 75% (Q3) are found in the ordered values.The variance and standard deviation are usually calculated to quantify the data distribution. Assuming a normal distribution, in the case of standard deviation, approximately 68% of all observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean, and approximately 95% of all observations fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

* Shape: 
>There are a number of metrics that define the shape and symmetry of the frequency distribution, including skewness, a measure of whether a variable is skewed to the left or right, and kurtosis, a measure of whether a variable has a flat or pointed central peak.

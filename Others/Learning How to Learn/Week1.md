# What is learning?
Welcome to the first week of Learning How to Learn! Since living brains are very complex, we begin our course by using metaphor（隐喻） and analogy（类推） to help simplify matters. In this module, you will discover several fundamentally different modes of thinking, and how you can use these modes to improve your learning. You will also be introduced to a tool for tackling procrastination（拖延）, be given some practical information about memory, and discover surprisingly useful insights about learning and sleep.

Extra Exploration: If you want to be extra prepared, the book A Mind for Numbers (which is not required, but which formed the basis for this MOOC) is available in many different languages, editions, and locations worldwide. This book gives you a chance to reinforce the great learning approaches from the course—you can write in the margins or make an electronic note to help further 'chunk' the ideas.

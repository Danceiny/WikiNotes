# Social Issues

>1. The premise that our society is different from what it would have been without the computer revolution is generally accepted. Is our society better than it would have been without the revolution? Is our society worse? Would your answer differ if your position within society were different?

答：计算机革命对社会显然是有益的，社会因此变得更好。立足于我的位置，代表世界上绝大多数人的利益。对于旧有的专制统治集团，计算机革命尤其是互联网浪潮让他们的统治更难，因此对他们来说是更糟了。对于至今还未享受到这一技术革新所带来的红利的人群，物质精神财富的相对差距在增大，因此也可以说是更糟了。

>2. Is it acceptable to participate in today's technical society without making an effort to understand the basics of that technology? For instance, do members of a democracy, whose votes often determine how technology will be supported and used, have an obligation to try to understand that technology? Does your answer depend on which technology is being considered? For example, is your answer the same when considering nuclear technology as when considering computer technology?

答：在当今的技术社会，我认为不理解技术的基础是不可接受的。不取决于某一项技术。但是，对于关系切身利益（无论是主观上还是客观上）的技术，不管是核技术还是计算机技术，我认为都有必要建构一个最基本的理解。


>3. By using cash in financial transactions, individuals have traditionally had the option to manage their financial affairs without service charges. However, as more of our economy is becoming automated, financial institutions are implementing service charges for access to these automated systems. Is there a point at which these charges unfairly restrict an individual's access to the economy? For example, suppose an employer pays employees only by check, and all financial institutions were to place a service charge on check cashing and depositing. Would the employees be unfairly treated? What if an employer insists on paying only via direct deposit?

答： 自动化电子支付导致木有小费，这个嘛，我不是很能感同身受。既然潮流如此，我觉得西方社会重构这个小费习惯也不无不妥吧，小费的缺失那就通过涨工资弥补咯。

>4. In the context of interactive television, to what extent should a company be allowed to retrieve information from children(perhaps via an interactive game format)? For example, should a company be allowed to obtain a child's report on his or her parents' buying patterns? What about information about the child?

答：交互式电视环境下，对于儿童信息获取程度的限制，我认为应当是基于一个助力儿童健康成长的大原则的。至于从儿童父母的购物习惯中获取儿童的资料报告，我认为是可以的。但是我认为任何有关于儿童的个人隐私信息，都有必要在儿童家长甚至儿童本人知情的情况下存储并利用，并享有完全控制权，比如家长可要求公司彻底删除有关信息。

>5. To what extent should a government regulate computer technology and its applications? Consider, for example, the example, the issues mentioned in Questions 3 and 4. What justifies government regulation?

答：政府对计算机技术及其应用的控制，尤其是互联网海量信息的控制，我认为有两点：一是人民应当赋予政府权力基于对人民的保护职责而享有的完全监控权；二是政府的监管控制权力应当有一套行之有效的监管办法，以防止被滥用。监管政府的，只能是人民，在这里可以是全体人民委托技术圈建立的监管组织，可以对政府的监控要求享有审批权。至于事关国防等重要机密，政府可特事特办，当然这需要建立在强大的公信力基础上，否则一旦该权限经常激活，势必引发信任危机。

>6. To what extent will our decisions regarding technology in general, and computer technology in particular, affect future generations?

答：我们对待技术的尤其是计算机技术的态度，将直接影响下一代的世界观和方法论，这个影响将是尤为深远的，特别是涉及克隆、人工智能等人类社会伦理相关的技术的态度取向。

>7. As technology advances, our educational system is constantly challenged to reconsider the level of abstraction at which topics are presented. Many questions take the form of whether a skill is still necessary or whether students should be allowed to rely on an abstract tool. Students of trigonometry are no longer taught how to find the values of trigonometric functions using tables. Instead, they use calculators as abstract tools to find these values. Some argue that long division should also give way to abstraction. What other subjects are involved with similar controversies? Do modern word processors eliminate the need to develop spelling skills? Will the use of video technology someday remove the need to read?

答：技术进步挑战了教育系统，传统的知识教育抽象水平不高，这也是由于知识的总量（存量）有限所决定的。而今知识的存量巨大，且增量惊人，而人脑在这个历史时期内尚无进步，则必然要求抽象程度的提升，伴之社会分工程度的加剧，以此来完成人类知识的传递与发展。拿电子工程师来说，现在很少要求他们懂得如何制造一个三极管，尽管三极管的使用极其广泛频繁，但是已被高度抽象化。现代文字处理器不会消除练习拼写技巧的需求，视频技术的使用也不会消除阅读的需要，当然，它们将极大极深刻地改变以往的书写阅读习惯，并且占据主体位置，但是，这种竞争是共生竞争，而非殊死竞争。

>8. The concept of public libraries is largely based on the premise that all citizens in a democracy must have access to information. As more information is stored and disseminated via computer technology, does access to this technology become a right of every individual? If so, should public libraries be the channel by which this access if provided?

答：获取信息技术应当是每个人都可以享有的个人权利，公共图书馆可以是提供这样的公众权利的机构。

>9. What ethical concerns arise in a society that relies on the use of abstract tools? Are there cases in which it is unethical to use a product or service without understanding how it works? Without knowing how it is produced? Or, whithout understanding the byproducts of its use?

答：对抽象工具的依赖，可能导致底层实作精神的缺失。不理解所抽象对象的实现机理（包括如何生产制成）而使用该产品或服务，并非不道德，我不认为有这样的案例。若不了解使用的副作用，可能是不道德的，因为这不仅可能危害个人，更有可能危害社会，这是公共道德的范畴。

>10. As our society becomes more automated, it becomes easier for governments to monitor their citizens' activities. Is that good or bad?

答：好。但是随之而来的，应该是政府与民众关系的革新。生产力决定生产关系，生产关系需要适应生产力的发展。

>11. Which technologies that were imagined by George Orwell(Eric Blair) in his novel 1984 have become reality? Are they being used in the maner in which Orwell predicted?

答：无处不在的监控，这点基本已实现。是的，例如棱镜门。

>12. If you had a time machine, in which period of history would you like to live? Are there current technologies that you would like to take with you? Could your choice of technologies be taken with you without taking others? To what extent can one technology be separated from another? Is it consistent to protest against global warming yet accept modern medical treatment?

答：如果必须是过去的话，我选择康乾时期。想带计算机过去。必须要带“助手”，自己一个人hold不住啊。当前技术的独立性应该是很低的，依存度非常高。

>13. Suppose your job requires that you reside in another culture. Should you continue to practice the ethics of your native culture or adopt the ethics of your host culture? Does your answer depend on wheter the issue involves dress code or human rights? Which ethical standards should prevail if you continue to reside in your native culture but conduct business with a foreign culture?

答：做人就要不忘本。不管是穿衣风格还是人权问题。求同存异。

>14. Has society become too dependent on computer applications for commerce, communications, or social interactions? For example, what would be the consequences of a long-term interruption in Internet and/or cellular telephone service?

答：是的。短期内瘫痪，长期混乱，可能导致国际政治经济军事格局重新洗牌。

>15. Most smartphones are able to identify the phone's location by means of GPS. This allows applications to provide location-specific information(such as the local news, local weather, or the presence of businesses in the immediate area) based on the phone's current location. However, such GPS capabilities may also allow other applications to broadcast the phone's location to other parties. Is this good? How could knowledge of the phone's location(thus your location) be abused?

答：不好。GPS信息不可广播给非授信组织。

>16. On the basis of your initial answers to the preceding questions, to which ethical theory presented in Section 0.6 do you tend to subscribe?

答：哲学思考很关键。需要有柏拉图和亚里士多德这样伟大的哲学家对现在的“技术改变生活”相关问题深刻探讨。

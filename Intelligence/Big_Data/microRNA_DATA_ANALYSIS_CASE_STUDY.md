# Defining the Problem
A total of 279 microRNAs were tested against the 60 cancer cell lines detailed in Table 5.1.
The data has been generated to answer a number of questions, including:
1. Is it possible to use the data to classify tissue types, such as melanoma, lung, and so on, by microRNA expression patterns?
2. Is it possible to predict the tissue type by microRNA expression level?

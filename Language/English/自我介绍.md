Good afternoon, everybody. It's realy my honor to have this opportunity to communicate with all of you. Now i'll introduce myself briefly, maybe nervously.
My name is Huang Zhen, born in 1996. I come from Hunan and i like eating pepper, red or green. Now I am studying in HUST, my major is ee/cs. Recently I focused on preparation for finding a job. And my hobbies are various, nba/reading/movies/programming etc. Politics is also my interest. I'd like to make friends on GitHub, a social websites for programmers. Glad to see you. Thanks.

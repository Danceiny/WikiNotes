The tool will locate the dangerous function calls and track hits to those
functions. When a function that we deemed to be dangerous gets called, we
will dereference four parameters off the stack (as well as the return address
of the caller) and snapshot the process in case that function causes an overflow condition. If there is an access violation, our script will rewind the process to the last dangerous function hit. From there it single-steps the target application and disassembles each instruction until we either throw the access violation again or hit the maximum number of instructions we want to inspect. Anytime you see a hit on a dangerous function that matches data you have sent to the application, it is worth taking a look at whether you can manipulate the data to crash the application. This is the first step toward creating an
exploit.

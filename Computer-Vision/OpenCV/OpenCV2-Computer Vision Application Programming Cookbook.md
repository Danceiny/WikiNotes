# What this book covers 
Chapter 1, Playing with Images, introduces the OpenCV library and shows you how to run simple applications using the MS Visual C++ and Qt development environments.
Chapter 2, Manipulating the Pixels, explains how an image can be read. It describes different
methods for scanning an image in order to perform an operation on each of its pixels. You will
also learn how to define region of interest inside an image.
Chapter 3, Processing Images with Classes, consists of recipes which present various objectoriented design patterns that can help you to build better computer vision applications.
Chapter 4, Counting the Pixels with Histograms, shows you how to compute image histograms
and how they can be used to modify an image. Different applications based on histograms are
presented that achieve image segmentation, object detection, and image retrieval.
Chapter 5, Transforming Images with Morphological Operations, explores the concept of
mathematical morphology. It presents different operators and how they can be used to detect
edges, corners, and segments in images.
Chapter 6, Filtering the Images, teaches you the principle of frequency analysis and image
filtering. It shows how low-pass and high-pass filters can be applied to images. It presents the
two image derivative operators: the gradient and the Laplacian.
Chapter 7, Extracting Lines, Contours, and Components, focuses on the detection of geometric image features. It explains how to extract contours, lines, and connected components in an image.
Chapter 8, Detecting and Matching Interest Points, describes various feature point detectors in images. It also explains how descriptors of interest points can be computed and used to match points between images.
Chapter 9, Estimating Projective Relations in Images, analyzes the different relations involved in image formation. It also explores the projective relations that exist between two images of a same scene.
Chapter 10, Processing Video Sequences, provides a framework to read and write a video
sequence and to process its frames. It also shows you how it is possible to track feature points from frame to frame, and how to extract the foreground objects moving in front of a camera.
# What this book covers 2nd Edition
Chapter 1, Playing with Images, introduces the OpenCV library and shows you how to
build simple applications that can read and display images. It also introduces the basic
OpenCV data structures.
Chapter 2, Manipulating Pixels, explains how an image can be read. It describes different
methods for scanning an image in order to perform an operation on each of its pixels.
Chapter 3, Processing Color Images with Classes, consists of recipes that present various
object-oriented design patterns that can help you build better computer vision applications.
It also discusses the concept of colors in images.
Chapter 4, Counting the Pixels with Histograms, shows you how to compute image
histograms and how they can be used to modify an image. Different applications based on
histograms are presented, and they achieve image segmentation, object detection, and
image retrieval.
